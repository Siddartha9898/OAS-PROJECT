# OAS-PROJECT
Design a scheduler following non-preemptive scheduling approach to schedule the processes that arrives at different units and having burst time double the arrival time. Scheduler selects the process with largest burst time from the queue for the execution. Process is not being preempted until it finishes its service time.
